How to Run:

1.	Install Requirements:

o	Install Java Development Kit (JDK 11 or above).

o	Download and set up the JavaFX SDK on your system. Extract the SDK to a folder (e.g., C:\javafx-sdk-23.0.1).

2.	Run via Command Line:

Navigate to the directory containing RecipeManagementSystem.java and run the following commands:

â€¢	Compile the application: 

:-	javac --module-path "C:\javafx-sdk-23.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml RecipeManagementSystem.java

â€¢	Run the application: 

:-	java --module-path "C:\javafx-sdk-23.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml RecipeManagementSystem

NOTE: Replace this "C:\javafx-sdk-23.0.1\lib" with the actual path to your JavaFX SDK's lib folder.

3.	Better Alternative:
It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for a smoother experience, as it simplifies running and debugging.

Future Improvements:
â€¢	Add persistent storage using files or databases.
â€¢	Categorize recipes into groups like Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, etc.
â€¢	Enhance the user interface with better styling.
